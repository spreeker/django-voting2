    I wanted to proved voting for anynymous users. But once they registered i wanted their
    session votes saved as real votes. I did it with the use of some middleware.

    If you make your views save votes in the vote_history session variable with 
    { object_id , direction } key values in it. on registration their votes will be saved
    as real votes if you add this code to your middleware.
